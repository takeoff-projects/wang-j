Things that were done manually (outside of terraform)
- Enabling APIs (ran into issues with repeated activations so it was removed)
  - cloud function
  - firestore
  - cloud storage
  - apigateway.googleapis.com
  - servicemanagement.googleapis.com
  - servicecontrol.googleapis.com	
- Inital provisioning of Firestore DB (same reason as above)
- Setting up service account for terraform to use (should've been included in a script probablyh)
- Downloadng all the go.mod/sum stuff (I don't think this matters for the runtime of the cloud function at all)
